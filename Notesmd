##Prerequisites
1. Docker desktop should be installed on your laptop and should be running for the course of this lab/test

##Steps
- We will be running a container so that we can access the backend 
- Create a directory and go into it and create another directory.
```
mkdir development
cd development
mkdir opentelemetry-starting
cd opentelemetry-starting
```
- To configure/instrument our application so that we can have our observability tool, we will paste the following:
``` 
docker run --rm -d -p 9411:9411 --name zipkin openzipkin/zipkin
```
- We will install a package JSON file to make it easier for others to manage the packages required
```npm init```

-
